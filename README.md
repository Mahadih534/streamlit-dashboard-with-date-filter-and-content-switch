## Youtube: https://youtu.be/uDuPM4xfPlw

most important thing today is to use the data you have as a source of business insights, decision and development by looking at where you are doing better in product sales and where you are not doing well. 

There are many Business Intelligent softwares that are used to prepare business reports such as MICROSOFT EXCEL and POWER-BI, along with those softwares, there is also a python library called Streamlit.

Streamlit  is special python Package  for data science and machine learning and its advantage is that: it has the ability to create driven and interactive web  dashboard that will be seen by many users in the company and also has the ability to work across the internet

in this video I have tried to show how you will be able to create a web analytics dashboard for inventory business trends where you will look at the business trend by selecting the date range, city, or type of product to see where the efficiency is in that trend

streamlit is a library that uses very little coding energy and you get very good analytics results even if you don't know HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT
